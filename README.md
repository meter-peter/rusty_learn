# Rusty Learn

Rusty Learn is an ambitious open-source project aiming to create a comprehensive suite of machine learning libraries in Rust. Our goal is to build a fast, efficient, and easy-to-use ecosystem that rivals popular Python libraries. Rusty Learn is designed to cater to a wide range of users, from machine learning beginners to advanced researchers and practitioners.

We are actively seeking contributors to help us build and maintain RustyLearn. Whether you are a Rust enthusiast, a machine learning expert, or simply passionate about open-source projects, we welcome your support and collaboration!

## Scope and Objectives

The primary objectives of Rusty Learn are:

1.  **Performance**: Leverage Rust's speed, efficiency, and type-safety to create high-performance machine learning libraries that can outperform their Python counterparts.
    
2.  **Usability**: Provide a user-friendly API that is consistent, well-documented, and easy to learn, making RustyLearn accessible to both beginners and experts.
    
3.  **Modularity**: Create a modular architecture that allows users to mix and match components as needed, facilitating rapid experimentation and customization.
    
4.  **Interoperability**: Ensure compatibility with popular machine learning frameworks, data formats, and tools, enabling seamless integration into existing workflows.
    
5.  **Community-driven**: Foster an active and inclusive community to drive the project's development, encouraging contributions from a diverse range of users.
